    <h1>Gun Violence Statistics</h1>
    <h4>In 2021, The number of firearm suicides were 26,328</h4>
    <h4>In 2023, there are already more than 25,000 lives lost due to gun violence as of August, which half were due to suicide.</h4>
    <p></p> Of those who died, 879 were teens and 170 were children.</p>
    <p>Reasoning could be because of the early age of which firearms can be exchanged, and early adulthood is very
      overwhelming, and due to the mass shootings going on in America.</p>

    <br>
    <h1>Spreading Awareness</h1>
    <p>With the rise in gun violence, it is important to spread awareness. There are multiple ways to do so, such as...
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li>Educate Yourself</li>
      <p>Be sure to avoid false information, as there is a lot of it on the internet. Make sure to fact check and see
        what the government is doing with the gun violence issue and get involved.</p>

      <li>Get involved in your community</li>
      <p>To start advocating, you need to look at how an issue can affect your community. An example would be that gun
        violence makes an unsafe enviroment to children. To get involved, consider getting involved into childrens
        schools districts, and seeing how they are reacting to the issue.</p>

      <li>Posting about it</li>
      <p>With social media, people can reach out to the world much easier. Social media is a great place to show others
        the danger of certain problems, such as gun violence.</p>

      <li>Reach out to the people who can help you</li>
      <p>It may seem improbable, but if you devote your time, you could find people who will help you in spreading
        awareness.
        There are lots of people who devote their life to advacating to causes. </p>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div id="Regulations">
    <br>
    <h1>Gun Regulations</h1>
    <br>
    <p>While gun regulations vary on state to state, the federal law states the minimum age to carry the gun is 18.
      While most states have increased the minimum age to 21, which some would say is still to young to have a deadly
      weapon, as the suicide rates by gun have increased.</p>

    <p>Other than a young age and simple background check, there is nothing more needed to purchase a gun. It may be
      that a gun reform is needed.</p>

  </div>
  <div id="Experience">
    <br>
    <h1>Share your Story</h1>
    <p>With the rapid increase in gun violence, it is incredibly important to share your experiences with other to show
      awareness.</p>
    <p>Please write below with your personal experience regarding how you've been affected by gun violence.</p>
